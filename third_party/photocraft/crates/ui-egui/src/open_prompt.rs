//! Ask When Opening (Edit › Color Settings): a file whose embedded profile doesn't match the
//! working space (or that has none) is held back while a prompt asks what to do, as Photoshop
//! does: one prompt at a time, naming its file, before that file opens. OK applies the answer to
//! that file and opens it, then asks about the next; Cancel opens neither it nor the files still
//! to come. Files that finish reading while a prompt is up wait their turn, so they open in order.
